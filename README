This directory contains the OpenMP parallelized version of the
optimized MKDE code.

The halo variable (hardcoded at line 158) determines the cutoff in
each direction for the kernel calculation. Currently uses a crude cube
of voxels, so there is room for improvement. If the halo is set large
enough, it probbly doesn't really matter if we use a cube, sphere or
flattened ellipsoid.

halo_50 and halo_100 files have summary of output, including max voxel
value, sum over voxels and sum over voxels multiplied by voxel volume
for the Condor data set.

NOTE - when using Condor data, make sure that ALL lines containing NAN
have been removed.
