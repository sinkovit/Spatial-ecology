# Spatial-ecology (Bob branch)

This branch contains Bob's software development.

* Experiments - stuff that's purely for Bob's internal use
* mkde-OpenMP - parallel version of the mkde code
* seg-functions - Spatial Ecology Gateway functions

Within seg-functions, the R files starting with underscores are for
testing purposes and do not need to be integrated into the main
branch. The other R files contain fnctionality that can be integrated
