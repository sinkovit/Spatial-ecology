# Spatial-ecology
Space use software deployed in the Spatial Ecology Gateway

* The structure of this repo is to match HUBZero's tool's register structure
requirement (see Nano Hub's template @
https://github.com/nanohub-apps/hubtooljupytertemplate).
* Previous code is in the "Bob" branch.
* We aim to follow the Tidyverse style guide @ https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html

### Container
We are making our space use software available to be used in a container.  This allows you to run your own container with all the required software already installed.

#### Requirements
1. Stadia Map key - our software will require that you have a Stadia Map key.  There is a free tier.  Instructions for setting up your key can be found [here](https://docs.stadiamaps.com/authentication/#api-keys).
